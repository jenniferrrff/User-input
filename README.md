# User-input

Mountains: The mountains are now interactive, responding to user input. By clicking and dragging, users can adjust the mountain's position on the x-axis, giving a sense of depth and interaction. This drag effect is a significant departure from the static mountains in the original code.

Sky: The sky's gradient evolves over time, simulating a day-night cycle. This is controlled by the toggleDayNight function, which alters the background colour when 'd' is pressed. 

Shines (Stars): Stars are added to the sky when the 't' key is pressed, each with a random position and size, simulating a starry night sky. This interactive element allows the user to populate the sky with stars.
